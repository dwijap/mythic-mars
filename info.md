## Inspiration
For centuries, the Red Planet has intrigued and bewildered humankind. Now that we are closer than ever to paying our neighbor a visit, itâ€™s time to revisit our ancient connections and gather new perspectives. Our mission is to integrate the numerous ways that humankind has thought about and experienced Mars throughout history with the most recent data collected. 

## What it does
Our website is an interactive and easy-to-use educational tool that functions as a Google Maps for Mars. An AI-powered search engine leverages our custom database created using scientific data, historical literature, and detailed maps. 

## How we built it
We crawled data from NASA HiRISE data, the Digital Museum of Planetary Mapping, Wikipedia, and other public sources to train a natural language processing model. This AI model can recognize patterns in keywords from the texts and map different sources to features on the Martian surface.
